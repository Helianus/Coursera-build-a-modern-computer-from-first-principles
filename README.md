### Week1

NAND Gate:

| A    | B    | Output |
| :--- | ---- | ------ |
| 0    | 0    | 1      |
| 0    | 1    | 1      |
| 1    | 0    | 1      |
| 1    | 1    | 0      |

From NAND to build NOT Gate:

NOT Gate:

| In   | out  |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0    | 1    |
| 1    | 0    |

- Since A=0 and B=0 will output 1 which implies in=0 and output=1.
- Since A=1 and B=1 will output 0 which implies in=1 and output=0.
